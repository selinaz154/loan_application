LendingClub is a platform that allows individuals to borrow money â€“ that is, take on loans. They've made available a massive dataset with information on millions of loans they've processed.

In this project, I exploed how various borrower characteristics are related to one another, 
in an attempt to better understand the complexity behind loans. It's important to remember, though, that this dataset only contains information about actually approved loans, not all loan applications.
